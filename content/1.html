<h1> I love exploring new things everyday </h1><br />
    <br />
    Everyday is a new opportunity to explore something new. Whether it’s the latest technology trend, a new programming language, or a cool basketball move, I strive to always learn something new each day. I take the time to research, understand, and most importantly, to enjoy the process.<br />
<br />
Learning new things can be scary. It is easy to be overwhelmed; but with the right mindset and attitude, I have learned how to make progress. It can take effort and time to master a new skill, but it is worth it in the end.<br />
<br />
As for my passions, I'll spend hours coding and debugging Python scripts or trying to perfect my basketball moves. I'm always striving to be the best version of myself by challenging my skills and pushing the boundaries.<br />
<br />
I enjoy the process of learning new things and believe that the information I learn, even the seemingly small details, have the potential to make a big difference. It's what keeps me going and I'm excited to see what I can learn and discover next!</body>
